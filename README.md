# Splunk-Home-Lab
This repository documents my cybersecurity home lab designed to detect and analyze phishing campaigns using Splunk and Snort. The lab demonstrates how to:

Ingest labeled email datasets into Splunk to track over 80 phishing campaigns.

Analyze user behavior, such as clicks on phishing links, and extract email header information for threat intelligence.

Integrate Snort IDS with Splunk to simulate interactions with phishing emails and monitor suspicious activity in real time.
